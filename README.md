# statigraph
A graph theory-inspired browser game

Nodes are connected by Edges.

Click a Node to transfer some of its value to connected Nodes.

Try to equalize the graph--make all Nodes have 0 value.

Thick edges transfer 2 value each click.

Directed edges are one-way.

Dotted edges only transfer value every other click, when they are fully opaque.

CTRL+Z to undo.
